                    This summer I decided that Europe is finally on the agenda.  So here I am in sunny western Wallachia.  I was planning on moving on to Transylvannia next week but I may travel there early.  There's some strange scary creature roaming the countryside at night according to the locals and they don't appear to be in the best of moods today.  I did enjoy the night I spent touring the sights.  The local graveyards are beautiful in the moonlight and the gothic buildings have wonderful views from their rooftops.  Maybe next time I'll be able to stay with a local and try the local cuisine.
