        Born in 1750 in Chokkilissa'-Old Town, Mississipi, Tushatohoa (Mountain Leader) earned his name from the Cherokee.  Through his eploits throughout his life he became the Hopayi Minko (shortened to Piominko) or "War Prophet King", both a spiritual and war/warrior leader. He travelled to several of the early states meeting with and befriending leaders such as George Washington and securing treaties on behalf of his people.  He died of natural causes near modern day Tupelo Mississippi in 1799.
