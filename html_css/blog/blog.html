                Now I'm really annoyed.  All my flights have been cancelled and I'm stuck back in Egypt.  It's no fun here anymore.  Nothing to do, nowhere to go.  I'm bored out of my mind.  Maybe I'll dig up an old friend for a visit and a chat.

                I'm here in lovely Wuhan China.  Saw the Great Wall last week.  It's much different than I remember.  Last time I saw it, it was only a few kilometers long.  Been feeling a little under the weather lately.  Think I might have the tomb curse cold again.  Well, off to visit the local markets.

                    This summer I decided that Europe is finally on the agenda.  So here I am in sunny western Wallachia.  I was planning on moving on to Transylvannia next week but I may travel there early.  There's some strange scary creature roaming the countryside at night according to the locals and they don't appear to be in the best of moods today.  I did enjoy the night I spent touring the sights.  The local graveyards are beautiful in the moonlight and the gothic buildings have wonderful views from their rooftops.  Maybe next time I'll be able to stay with a local and try the local cuisine.
